                    <h1>Eyebrows Microshading</h1>
                    <h2>at a Glance</h2>

                    <p><span>Procedure Time:</span>
                    </p>
                    <p>The procedure time for Semi-Permanent Eyebrow Microshading typically ranges from 1.5 to 2.5
                        hours, although it can vary depending on individual factors and the specific technique used by
                        the technician.</p>

                    <p><span>Number of Treatments:</span></p>
                    <p>Achieving the desired results with Semi-Permanent Eyebrow Microshading often requires more than
                        one session. In most cases, clients will need two sessions:</p>

                    <p>Initial Session: During the first appointment, the technician will create the initial shape and
                        fill in the eyebrows with micro shading. This sets the foundation for the final look.</p>
                    <p>Touch-up Session: Approximately 4 to 6 weeks after the initial session, a follow-up appointment,
                        known as a touch-up session, is required. This allows the technician to make any necessary
                        adjustments, deepen the color, and ensure the longevity of the results.</p>
                    <p>Duration of Results: The duration of results from Semi-Permanent Eyebrow Microshading can vary
                        from person to person, but on average, it lasts between 1 to 3 years. Several factors can
                        influence how long the results last, including skin type, lifestyle, and exposure to the sun.
                        Over time, the pigments will gradually fade, and the color may change slightly. To maintain the
                        desired look, periodic touch-up sessions are recommended, typically every 12 to 18 months.</p>

                    </p>
                    <p>Your journey to beautiful brows at Skintastic begins with a consultation. During this session,
                        you’ll discuss your brow goals, preferences, and concerns with our expert technicians. Together,
                        you’ll create a customized plan for your perfect brows.</p>

                    <p><span>Design</span>

                        </span></p>
                    <p>The Microshading procedure is comfortable and minimally invasive, thanks to the use of numbing
                        creams. Our technicians use fine-point needles to deposit pigments in the skin, creating a
                        natural and realistic brow effect. The process typically takes a few hours.</p>

                    <h2>Aftercare</h2>
                    <p>After your Semi-Permanent Eyebrow Microshading treatment at Skintastic, it’s important to follow
                        some simple aftercare instructions:</p>

                    <p>Avoid Sun Exposure: Protect your newly enhanced brows from the sun’s harmful rays.</p>

                    <p> No Excessive Moisture: Avoid excessive moisture on the brow area for the first few days to allow
                        the pigments to settle properly.</p>

                    <p> No Makeup: While your brows heal, it’s best to avoid applying makeup to the treated area.
