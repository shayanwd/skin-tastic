                    <h1>Semi Permanent Makeup</h1>
                    <p>Semi-permanent makeup, also known as micro pigmentation or cosmetic tattooing, is a popular beauty procedure that involves the application of pigments to the skin’s surface to enhance or mimic the look of makeup. Unlike traditional makeup that needs to be applied and removed daily, semi-permanent makeup offers long-lasting results.

                    <h2>at a Glance</h2>
                    <p>Semi-permanent makeup involves the use of specialized equipment and techniques to deposit pigments into the upper layers of the skin. These pigments are carefully chosen to match the desired makeup effect, such as eyebrows, eyeliner, or lip color.</p>

                    <p><span>Common Applications:
                    </p>

                    <p><span>Eyebrows: </span> Semi-permanent makeup is frequently used to create or enhance the appearance of eyebrows. This can involve filling in sparse areas, reshaping brows, or even adding a completely new eyebrow design.
                    </p>

                    <p><span>Eyeliner: </span>It can be applied along the lash line to define and enhance the eyes. This is particularly beneficial for individuals who want the look of eyeliner without daily application.
                    </p>
                    <p><span>Lips:</span>Lip blush or lip color tattooing can be used to add natural-looking color to the lips, improve symmetry, or create fuller-looking lips.</p>
