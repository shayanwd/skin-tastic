                    <h1>Eyeliner</h1>
                    <p>Semi-permanent eyeliner is a revolutionary cosmetic procedure that involves the application of
                        pigment along the lash line to create a long-lasting eyeliner effect. Unlike traditional
                        eyeliner, which requires daily application and often smudges, semi-permanent eyeliner can last
                        for years with proper care. It’s the secret behind those flawless, always-ready eyes you’ve been
                        admiring on your favorite celebrities.</p>

                <h6>Q: What’s the difference between semi-permanent and permanent eyeliner?</h6>

                <p>A:Semi-permanent eyeliner fades over time and allows for style changes. Permanent eyeliner, as the name suggests, is permanent and less flexible in terms of style adjustments.</p>

                <h6>Q: Does the procedure hurt?</h6>

                <p>A: Most clients report minimal discomfort, often described as a slight scratching sensation. A numbing cream is applied before the procedure to minimize any discomfort.

                </p>

                <h6>Q: Can I choose the thickness and style of my eyeliner?</h6>

                <p>A: Absolutely! Skintastic offers a range of thicknesses and styles to suit your preferences and facial features.

                </p>
                <h6>Are there any side effects I should be aware of?</h6>
                <p>While rare, some clients may experience minor swelling or redness immediately after the procedure. These effects typically subside within a few hours to a day.</p>
                <h6>Can I remove semi-permanent eyeliner if I change my mind?

                </h6>
                <p>Yes, it’s possible to remove semi-permanent eyeliner, although it may require multiple sessions. Skintastic also offers removal services if you decide to change your look.
