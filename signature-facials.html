                    <h1>Signature Facial </h1>
                    <h2>At a Glance</h2>
                    <p>
                        Unlike conventional facial treatments, Signature facial masks are designed to provide care tailored to specific skin types. Our facial care deeply cleanses, exfoliates, and hydrates the skin while preventing blemishes, and improving the smoothness and
                        appearance of the skin.
                    </p>

                    <p><span>Product Time:</span> The entire process takes about 60 to 70 minutes and addresses all of your skin’s needs while providing significant nourishment and a gorgeous glow.
                    </p>

                    <p><span>Number of treatments
                        </span> You can undergo 1 to 6 Signature Facial sessions with a two-week interval between sessions. This whole cycle could be done twice a year. Depending on the condition of your skin, your esthetician may adjust the number of
                        sessions to your personal needs and goals.


                    </p>

                    <p><span>Duration of result: </span> A facial is one of the oldest treatments in the world for good reason – the results of this treatment can last for several weeks and enhance the tone, texture, and overall appearance of your skin.
                        Usually, the results of the facial will last for about four to six weeks.
                    </p>

                </div>

                <div class="hydrafacial-at-a-glance">
                    <h2>Procedure</h2>
                    <p>
                        Consultation: A signature facial usually begins with a consultation with a certified skin care specialist or esthetician. During this session, you’ll talk about your skincare goals, concerns, and any specific concerns you’d like to address, such as acne,
                        aging, or dehydration.
                    </p>

                    <p><span>Skin examination:</span> After the consultation, the esthetician will perform a comprehensive examination of your skin. This includes determining the right products and procedures to use during a facial, as well as determining
                        your skin type and any problem areas.
                    </p>

                    <p><span>Cleaning:</span> To remove makeup, dirt, and pollutants from the top layer of the skin, start with a gentle cleanse. After this step, your skin is ready for a more intensive treatment
                    </p>

                    <p><span>Exfoliation:</span> An essential part of a trademark facial is exfoliation. An esthetician may use physical exfoliation (such as gentle scrubbing) or chemical exfoliants (such as alpha hydroxy acids or enzymes), depending on
                        your skin type and needs, to remove dead skin cells and promote smoother, more radiant skin.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>
                            Extraction:
                        </span> Blackheads, whiteheads, and other impurities may need to be manually extracted from your pores by your esthetician if necessary. This action can help your skin look cleaner.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>
                            Personalized treatment:
                        </span> Personalized treatment is the basis of a distinctive face. The esthetician will select certain serums, masks, or treatments based on your consultation and skin analysis and your skin’s requirements.
                        These can be, among other things, relaxation products, brightening treatments, anti-aging serums, or moisturizing masks.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>
                            Massage:
                        </span> A number of renowned facial treatments come with a soothing facial massage. This not only improves the overall experience but also aids lymphatic drainage, which can minimize swelling and increase
                        a healthy glow, as well as improve blood circulation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>
                            Eye and lip care:
                        </span> Special attention is often paid to the delicate skin around the eyes and lips. Specific products may need to be used to address issues such as dark circles, puffiness, or fine lines.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>
                            Finishing touches:
                        </span> After the mask or serums have achieved the desired results, your esthetician will apply moisturizer and sunscreen to protect and hydrate the skin.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <span>
                            Home care advice:
                        </span> Your esthetician will likely offer you personalized skin care advice and products to use at home to maintain the benefits of your typical face.
